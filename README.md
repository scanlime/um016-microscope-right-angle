# um016-microscope-right-angle

3D printable case parts for the 'um016' style HDMI 1080p microscope for
right-angle use in tight spaces.

You'll need the PCB, entire optics assembly, and self-tapping screws from the
original microscope assembly. The printed parts replace the top housing, letting
you mount the PCB (and connectors) at a right angle relative to the original
design, making the whole microscope much less tall.

The two halves can be assembled at any angle multiple of 45 degrees, by choosing
how they're aligned before installing screws in the side of the optics tube.
